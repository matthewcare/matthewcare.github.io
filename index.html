		<p>I am Matthew Care, a Computer Science student, studying at the University of Portsmouth UK, although originally from sunny Wales.</p>
		<p>I enjoy the simple pleasures of life, playing piano, talking to friends, watching films, listening to music etc; but that doesn't mean I always stay inside. I also enjoy rock climbing, and have been a member of many clubs where I have traveled the country climbing in a variety of outdoor locations. </p>
