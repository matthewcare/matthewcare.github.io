			<p>I am Matthew Care, a <a href="http://www.port.ac.uk/courses/coursetypes/undergraduate/BScHonsComputerScience/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> student, studying at the <a href="http://www.port.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Portsmouth</a> UK, although originally from sunny Wales.</p>
			<p>I enjoy the simple pleasures of life, playing piano, talking to friends, watching films, listening to music etc; but that doesn't mean I always stay inside. I also enjoy rock climbing, and have been a member of many clubs where I have traveled the country, climbing in a variety of outdoor locations.</p> 
			<p>Want to know more <a href="pages/about-me.html">about me</a> or perhaps take a look at my <a href="pages/webCV.pdf" target="_blank">curriculum vitae (CV)</a>?</p>
