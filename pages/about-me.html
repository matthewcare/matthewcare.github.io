			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>I'm a keen painist, and have been playing for around 10 years. Although I didn't take any exams and learnt hardly any theory (one of my biggest regrets), I can play a wide range of styles, and have been known to play a number of grade 8 pieces.</p>
			<p>Climbing is a big part of my life, despite not being able to participate as often as I'd like to at the moment due to univsersity work. My favourite climb was at Portland, where I climbed right on the coast in the hot weather before taking a swim in the sea. I've also climbed in Snowdonia, Chepstow, Guildford, Purbrook, and a number of other places.</p>
			<p>Before I moved away from Wales to start university I was an avid off-road biker, racing friends and getting some exercise. The best place by far that I went was a place called Tom's Farm in mid Wales; although it is closed now, and I broke my bike there, it was easily my favorite.</p>
